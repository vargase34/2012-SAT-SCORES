                    The NY State Grades 3–8 exams are scored by licensed
                    and trained New York City teachers. The exams are scored through a distributed scoring process,
                    meaning no student’s exam is scored by a teacher from the student’s school.
                    This scoring complies with NY State Education Department DOE policy
                    regarding scoring of State exams</p2>
